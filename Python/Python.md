# An Overview

Python is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted</a>, general purpose programming language, which also works really nicely as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scriping language</a>.
Python can be used to do literally anything today, ranging from data science products, to data analytics, to backend/server development and even some simple game development.

Python is relatively straightforward, and while it has multiple applications, if you learn the general purpose language itself, you can then apply it to do literally whatever you need.
<b>Note: There are two versions of Python being used today, Python 2 (generally 2.7) and Python 3 (3.6/3.7). I'd strongly recommend sticking to Python3, with Python2 being phased out by 2020. Consequently, all the tutorials I list below are for Python3</b>

## Useful Information:
- Python generally uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package managers</a> to allow you to install packages that other people have built, to make your life a lot easier. The two most popular are <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> and <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">anaconda</a>. I personally use pip, so I'm biased, but anaconda's easier to use if you're trying to get off the ground running.
- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">Codecademy's Python tutorial</a> is a great place to start
- The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/"> official Python3 documentation</a> is great too
- If you like video courses, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc">this one</a> is great.
- If you're trying to build websites, servers and the such, check out the Libraries/ folder for information on Flask and Django, or the Data/ folder if you want to check out how you can do cool stuff with data (both currently in development :)))
