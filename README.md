# BuildingSoftware
A collection of software development resources that I found useful while learning how to code, as well as build complete software products and webapps.

## An Overview
The languages covered for now are Javascript and Python, with documents supporting NodeJS, ReactJS, React Native and Flask.

## Just need a place to start?
You're probably here with one of two aims (maybe three). Pick whichever one sounds more like you below. 

### I want to build websites/apps
You probably want to pick up Flask to build functional web-apps and services, to get started. As a Python-based language, I definetly feel that it's the easiest to learn to get off the ground running. You'd probably want to get started with understanding HTML and CSS, and then move into Python and the Flask framework. Javascript would be a plus if you're trying to build interactive web-apps. Flask is generally paired with some HTML/CSS and Javascript. Later, you may want to check out platforms like ReactJS, or look into other server-side platforms like NodeJS. Check out both the section on Python and Flask (under the ```Libraries/``` folder) [here](https://github.com/raghavmecheri/BuildingSoftware/blob/master/Python/Python.md) as well the section on Javascript [here](https://github.com/raghavmecheri/BuildingSoftware/blob/master/Javascript/Javascript.md)


### I want to do cool stuff with data
Python and R are the two main languages that people use to deal with data collection, data analytics, machine learning, and all the other cool words that we hear get thrown around today. You probably want to get started with the basics of Python, and then head into the ```Data/``` folder to check our some libraries and platforms that you can use with Python, to really get your data to work for you. Check out the Python section and the Data/ folder [here](https://github.com/raghavmecheri/BuildingSoftware/blob/master/Python/Python.md)

### I want to publish what I've built for everyone to use
Check out the Deployment guide [here](https://github.com/raghavmecheri/BuildingSoftware/blob/master/Deployment/Deployment.md), which is still a work in progress.
