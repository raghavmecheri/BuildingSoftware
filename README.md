# LearnJS
A collection of software development resources that I found useful while learning languages like Python and Javascript, as well as their respective platforms :)

## Just need a place to start?
You probably want to pick up Flask to build functional web-apps and services, to get started. As a Python-based language, I definetly feel that it's the easiest to learn to get off the ground running. Flask is generally paired with some HTML/CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

## An Overview
The languages covered for now are Javascript and Python, with documents supporting NodeJS, ReactJS, React Native and Flask.
