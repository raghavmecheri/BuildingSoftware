# An Overview

Javascript is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scriping language</a>.
Most of the Internet today runs on Javascript, with it powering everything today from web-frontends (alongside HTML/CSS), to backends, to even some data-science pipelines.

There are some great Javascript courses out there, and while this document does not serve in any way as a replacement for any of them, it should be helpful with getting you started on the right path to getting familiar with this (admittedly) nuanced language.

## Useful Information:
- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codecademy's Javascript tutorial</a> is a great place to start
- Web Frontends can either be built using a combination of <a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/learn-vanilla-javascript-before-using-js-frameworks">Vanilla JS</a> and HTML/CSS, or a Javascript Library, and HTML/CSS. If you don't know much about HTML/CSS, <b>stop here</b>. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css">Check this out first.</a>
  - <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is also a very popular framework for frontend development.
- It's worth noting that Javascript has <b>different versions</b>. <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/es6-javascript-programmers-need-know/">ES6</a> is the latest Javascript version, and while a lot of JS is version agnostic, this is definitely worth remembering
  - Some libraries, like Node and React do require you to <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them">transpile</a> your ES6 code to an older version. More on that <a href="http://nicholasjohnson.com/blog/what-is-babel/">here</a>
