# Overview

<a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> is a Javascript library that uses states in order to render a web-frontend.
React is <b>frontend only</b>, and is usually paired with either a Node or Python server which serves the React webapp to the frontend.
Contrary to other web development practices, ReactJS works on a single HTML file, and uses states and boolean conditions to dynamically manage and render content dynamically to the page, giving it the illusion of multiple pages.
React can also work with Node to render on a server before being served. React Native is an extension of React, built to run on mobile devices.

## Useful Information:
- React is a <b>frontend framework</b>. It's used to build user-facing content, like the Github editor that you're reading this on.
- <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"> ReactJS has it's own tutorial</a>, which is a great place to start
- As always, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101">Codecademy is a good shout.
- To my knowledge, React does not support ES6 yet. However, we use <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-node-js-babel-setup">Babel to get around that</a> :)
  - If you use create-react-app to setup your ReactJS app, the Babel transpiler setup is configured by default
