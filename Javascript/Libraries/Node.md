# Overview

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> is a Javascript runtime, built on Chrome's V8 engine. It's biggest selling point is that it's really fast, and super scaleable. It allows you to build backend services/servers, that can either just stand alone as API endpoints, or can even serve frontend code.
Node is generally used with a wrapper library, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a> which is a great framework built upon NodeJS.

## Useful Information:
- Node is a <b>backend framework</b>. It's used to build services that either serve frontend code, or facilitate API calls. It does all the heavy lifting backend stuff that we love to abstract from our view. Some examples of this are:
  - Accessing/Reading/Writing a database
  - Serving frontend content
- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-express">Codecademy's Express tutorial</a> is a great place to start. Codecademy is just pretty solid overall.
- <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_express_framework.htm">TutorialsPoint</a> has a pretty solid ExpressJS tutorial too.
- If you want to just use plain Node, without the Express wrapper, check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/">W3Schools</a> tutorial.
- To my knowledge, Node does not support ES6 yet. However, we use <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-node-js-babel-setup">Babel to get around that</a> :)
